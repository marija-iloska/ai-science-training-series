# Example use of LLMs in Science

I can think of two examples. 

### Example 1
If we were to study the degree of impact of a certain published article or textbook that has a fairly large number of citations, the number itself does not necessarily reflect
the amount of impact that article has had on the publications that have cited it. It is not uncommon that researchers cite the source, simply because it already has a lot of citation, and therefore
seems reliable. In this case, we could use an LLM to compare text similarities between the cited article and the articles who cited it, and quantify the degree of impact. For this usage, the evaluations that
could be used are both extrinsic: sentiment analysis and/or text summarization.

### Example 2
This example has more to do with science education. While we cannot fully trust LLMs when it comes to accuracy, they are perfect for brainstorming and building ideas. I tested this on ChatGPT, and it is very
good at not only coming up with ideas for engineering camp projects for middle & high school levels, but also at putting together a curriculum or a program. Of course, in this case, we require human evaluation by 
the user who is creating the content for the projects, and they can double check by researching the proposed project online, and replicating the experiment to test.
