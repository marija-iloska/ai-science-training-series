# GROQ

The instructions are unclear to me. I couldn't install Groqflow. Each time I tried, my terminal would stop recognizing
even the basic commands such as "ls" or "mkdir". It did not allow me to run conda groqflow activate. When doing the installations
I got messages warning that the version of scipy is not compatible with the version of numpy. Some other similar warnings. I tried debugging and looking up
the errors myself, but the linux commands stopping each time made it very difficult to navigate or do anything. I don't have the experience to understand what are
the reasons for this.
